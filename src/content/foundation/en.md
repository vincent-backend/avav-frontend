  description: "Before you explain how to buy, explain the concepts. The AVAV inscription is attached to the Avalanche chain (avalanche chain) and is not a separate coin. The entire trading floor Avascriptions (also known as decentralized exchanges) is a program that runs on the AVAX-C chain (Avalanche EVM compatible chain). Transactions can only be made with AVAX tokens, which means that in order to purchase AVAV inscriptions, you must first hold AVAX tokens. The token purchase method is also very simple, just choose a large exchange (OKX, Binance) can be. After the purchase, you need to withdraw AVAX tokens to your Web3 wallet. Note here: the withdrawal will allow you to choose which chain to mention, if there is AVAX-C, choose this. If not, choose the AVAX chain. Make sure you choose the right one!<br>
  By this point you should have some AVAX tokens in your wallet! You're so close!<br>
  Here's how to buy AVAV inscriptions."
